# Tube Search

Tube Search is an application that allows users to search for and watch YouTube videos directly from the application.  This repo comes from a Hack Reactor project I worked on with a Pair Programmer.  This was my first attempt at working with React and external APIs.

## Setup
* run the babel command:
npx babel . --out-dir compiled --presets=@babel/preset-react --ignore=node_modules,compiled --source-maps inline
* live-server

Demo:

## Ultimate Goal

Given a legacy repo my pair programmer and I had to navigate through an incomplete repo and create a functioning YouTube video search application

## Step 1

* render the App component to the DOM
* create a dynamic Video List component with fake data for now

## Step 2

* once components are rendering fake data, set up so that the application interacts with the YouTube API

## Step 3

* build out a "Search" component
* Implement live-search feature
